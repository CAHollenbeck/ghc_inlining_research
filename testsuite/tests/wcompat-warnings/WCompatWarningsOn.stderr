Template.hs:5:1: warning: [-Wsemigroup (in -Wcompat)]
    Local definition of ‘<>’ clashes with a future Prelude name.
    This will become an error in a future release.

Template.hs:11:3: warning: [-Wnoncanonical-monoid-instances (in -Wdefault, -Wcompat)]
    Noncanonical ‘(<>) = mappend’ definition detected
    in the instance declaration for ‘Semigroup S’.
    Move definition from ‘mappend’ to ‘(<>)’

Template.hs:14:3: warning: [-Wnoncanonical-monoid-instances (in -Wdefault, -Wcompat)]
    Noncanonical ‘mappend’ definition detected
    in the instance declaration for ‘Monoid S’.
    ‘mappend’ will eventually be removed in favour of ‘(<>)’
    Either remove definition for ‘mappend’ (recommended) or define as ‘mappend = (<>)’
