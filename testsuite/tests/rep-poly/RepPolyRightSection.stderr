RepPolyRightSection.hs:14:11: error:
    • Unsaturated use of a representation-polymorphic primitive function.
      The third argument of ‘rightSection’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        a :: TYPE c0
      Cannot unify ‘r’ with the type variable ‘c0’
      because it is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the expression: `g` undefined
      In an equation for ‘test2’: test2 = (`g` undefined)
    • Relevant bindings include
        test2 :: a -> a (bound at RepPolyRightSection.hs:14:1)
