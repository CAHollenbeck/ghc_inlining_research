RepPolyTupleSection.hs:11:7: error:
    • The second component of the tuple section
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        t0 :: TYPE c0
      Cannot unify ‘r’ with the type variable ‘c0’
      because it is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the expression: (# 3#, #)
      In an equation for ‘foo’: foo = (# 3#, #)
    • Relevant bindings include
        foo :: a -> (# Int#, a #) (bound at RepPolyTupleSection.hs:11:1)
