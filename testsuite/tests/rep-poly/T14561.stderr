T14561.hs:12:9: error:
    • Unsaturated use of a representation-polymorphic primitive function.
      The first argument of ‘unsafeCoerce#’
      does not have a fixed runtime representation.
      Its type is:
        a0 :: TYPE c0
      Cannot unify ‘r’ with the type variable ‘c0’
      because it is not a concrete ‘RuntimeRep’.
    • In the expression: unsafeCoerce#
      In an equation for ‘badId’: badId = unsafeCoerce#
    • Relevant bindings include
        badId :: a -> a (bound at T14561.hs:12:1)
