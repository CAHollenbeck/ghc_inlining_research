T22912.hs:17:16: warning: [GHC-36038] [-Wloopy-superclass-solve (in -Wdefault)]
    I am solving the constraint ‘Implies c’,
      arising from the head of a quantified constraint
      arising from a use of ‘go’,
    in a way that might turn out to loop at runtime.
    Starting from GHC 9.10, this warning will turn into an error.
    See the user manual, § Undecidable instances and loopy superclasses.
    Suggested fix:
      Add the constraint ‘Implies
                            c’ to the context of the quantified constraint,
      even though it seems logically implied by other constraints in the context.
