.. _release-9-6-4:

Version 9.6.4
==============

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed below.
See the `migration guide
<https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/migration/9.6>`_ on the GHC Wiki
for specific guidance on migrating programs to this release.

The :ghc-flag:`LLVM backend <-fllvm>` of this release is to be used with LLVM
11, 12, 13, 14 or 15.

Significant Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issues fixed in this release include:

Compiler
--------

- Fix a code generator bug on AArch64 platforms resulting in invalid conditional
  jumps (:ghc-ticket:`23746`).
- Fix a simplifier bug that may cause segfaults and core lint failures due to
  incorrect handling of join points (:ghc-ticket:`23952`).
- Ensure unconstrained instance dictionaries get IPE info (:ghc-ticket:`24005`).
- Fix a bug where we could silently truncate 64 bit values to 32 bit on
  32 bit architectures.
- Fix a GHCi bug where a failure in the ``:add`` command would cause the
  process to exit (:ghc-ticket:`24115`).
- Fix a bug causing suboptimal error messages for certain invalid cyclic
  module graphs with hs-boot files (:ghc-ticket:`24196`).
- Fix a bug causing compiler panics with certain package databases involving
  unusable units and module reexports (:ghc-ticket:`21097`, :ghc-ticket:`16996`,
  :ghc-ticket:`11050`).
- Fix some memory leaks in GHCi that manifest on reloads (:ghc-ticket:`24107`,
  :ghc-ticket:`24118`).
- Fix a bug leading to some template haskell splices failing on being reloaded
  into GHCi due to not clearing the interactive context properly
  (:ghc-ticket:`23405`).
- Fix a type checker crash on certain programs involving implicitly scoped type
  variables (:ghc-ticket:`24083`).
- Fix a bug where certain warning flags were not recognised (:ghc-ticket:`24071`).
- Fix an incorrect assertion in the simplifier (:ghc-ticket:`23862`).

Runtime system
--------------

- Ensure concurrent thunk update is sound (:ghc-ticket:`23185`).
- Ensure the ``listAllBlocks`` function takes the non-moving heap into account
  (:ghc-ticket:`22627`).
- Ensure the non-moving GC is not running when pausing
- Fix some non-moving loops and bugs on Windows and LLP64 platforms
  (:ghc-ticket:`23003`, :ghc-ticket:`24042`).
- Fix a bug where certain programs could have incorrect async exception masking
  (:ghc-ticket:`23513`).
- Ensure we respect maximum event length and don't overflow into program
  memory (:ghc-ticket:`24197`).

Build system and packaging
--------------------------

- Ensure we use the right linker flags on AArch64 darwin (:ghc-ticket:`21712`,
  :ghc-ticket:`24033`).
- Fix a bug where ``-DNOSMP`` wasn't being passed to the C compiler even if the
  target doesn't support SMP (:ghc-ticket:`24082`).

Core libraries
--------------

- Fix a bug in ghc-bignum where usage of `bigNatIsPowerOf2` might result in
  out of bounds access (:ghc-ticket:`24066`).
- Bump ``base`` to 4.18.2.0
- base:  Update to Unicode 15.1.0
- Bump ``filepath`` to 1.4.200.1
- Bump ``unix`` to 2.8.4.0
- Bump ``haddock`` to 2.29.2
