.. _release-9-6-3:

Version 9.6.3
==============

The significant changes to the various parts of the compiler are listed below.
See the `migration guide
<https://gitlab.haskell.org/ghc/ghc/-/wikis/migration/9.6>`_ on the GHC Wiki
for specific guidance on migrating programs to this release.

The :ghc-flag:`LLVM backend <-fllvm>` of this release is to be used with LLVM
11, 12, 13, 14 or 15.

Significant Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Issues fixed in this release include:

Compiler
--------

- Disable Polymorphic Specialisation by default. It was discovered that Polymorphic
  Specialisation as currently implemented in GHC can lead to hard to diagnose bugs
  resulting in incorrect runtime results. Users wishing to use this optimisation
  despite the caveats will now have to explicitly enable the new ``-fpolymorphic-specialisation``
  flag. For more details see :ghc-ticket:`23469` as well as :ghc-ticket:`23109`,
  :ghc-ticket:`21229`, :ghc-ticket:`23445`.

- Fix a panic with the typechecker, reporting a type error instead of panicing
  on certain programs (:ghc-ticket:`22707`).

- Fix a bug preventing temporary directories created by GHC from being cleaned up
  after compilation (:ghc-ticket:`22952`).

- Fix the behaviour of the ``-keep-tmp-files`` when used in a ``OPTIONS_GHC``
  pragma (:ghc-ticket:`23339`).

- Fix a bug with certain warnings being swallowed when ``-fdefer-diagnostics``
  is enabled (:ghc-ticket:`23305`).

- Fix a bug leading to incorrect "Redundant Constraint" warnings
  (:ghc-ticket:`23323`, :ghc-ticket:`23143`).

- Fix the behaviour of ``-fsplit-sections`` on Windows (:ghc-ticket:`22834`).

- Fix some segfaults affecting users of ``UnliftedDatatypes``
  (:ghc-ticket:`23146`, :ghc-ticket:`23231`).

- Fix compiler panics with certain RULE pragmas (:ghc-ticket:`23208`,
  :ghc-ticket:`22761`).

- Fix a bug with ``.hie`` files containing spurious references to generated
  functions in files with partial field selectors (:ghc-ticket:`23492`).

- Fix a specialiser bug leading to compiler panics (:ghc-ticket:`23567`).

- Fix a bug preventing using the command line to compile ``.cmm`` files to
  assembly (:ghc-ticket:`23610`).

- Fix a compiler panic on certain programs with typed holes (:ghc-ticket:`22684`).

- Fix some simplifier panics due to incorrect scope tracking (:ghc-ticket:`23630`).

- Ensure array read operations have proper memory barriers (:ghc-ticket:`23541`).

- Make type equality ``(~)`` checks in the presence of quantified contrains more
  robust to argument ordering (:ghc-ticket:`23333`).

- Fix a number of bugs having to do with default representation polymorphic type
  variables (:ghc-ticket:`23153`, :ghc-ticket:`23154`, :ghc-ticket:`23176`).

- Fix the behaviour of the ``MulMayOflo`` operation on x86 and aarch64 (:ghc-ticket:`23721`).

- Make the recompilation check more robust when code generation flags are changed (:ghc-ticket:`23369`).

- With the aarch64 backend, fix a bug arising from lack of zero-extension for
  8/16 bit add/sub with immediate (:ghc-ticket:`23749`).

- Fix a bug in the STG rewriter leading to excess allocations in certain circumstances (:ghc-ticket:`23783`).

- Fix a typechecker bug leading to incorrect multiplicity checking with
  ``-XLinearTypes`` and ``-XMultiWayIf`` (:ghc-ticket:`23814`).

- Improve zonking behavior for defaulting plugins (:ghc-ticket:`23821`).

- Fix a recompilation checking bug impacting the relinking step, where we failed to
  relink if transitive dependencies were changed (:ghc-ticket:`23724`).

- Fix a code generator panic with unboxed tuples (:ghc-ticket:`23914`).

- Fix a simplifier panic due to incorrect eta reduction of a join point (:ghc-ticket:`23922`).

- Fix a simplifer bug leading to ``-dcore-lint`` failures (:ghc-ticket:`23938`).

- Add ``-finfo-table-map-with-fallback`` and ``-finfo-table-map-with-stack`` flags
  for info table profiling (:ghc-ticket:`23702`).

- Improve compile time and code generation performance when ``-finfo-table-map``
  is enabled (:ghc-ticket:`23103`).

Runtime system
--------------

- Performance improvements for the ELF linker (:ghc-ticket:`23464`).

- Fix warnings with clang 14.0.3 (:ghc-ticket:`23561`).

- Prevent some segfaults by ensuring that pinned allocations respect block size
  (:ghc-ticket:`23400`).

- Prevent runtime crashes in statically linked GHCi sessions on AArch64 by providing
  some missing symbols from the RTS linker (:ghc-ticket:`22012`).

- Improve bounds checking with ``-fcheck-prim-bounds`` (:ghc-ticket:`21054`).

- On Windows, ensure reliability of IO manager shutdown (:ghc-ticket:`23691`).

- Fix a bug with the GHC linker on windows (:ghc-ticket:`22941`).

- Properly escape characters when writing JSON profiles (``-pJ``) (:ghc-ticket:`23924`).

Build system and packaging
--------------------------

- Make hadrian more robust in the presence of symlinks (:ghc-ticket:`22451`).

- Allow building documentation with sphinx versions older than ``4.0`` along
  with older versions of ``python`` (:ghc-ticket:`23807`, :ghc-ticket:`23818`).

- Also build vanilla (non-static) alpine bindists (:ghc-ticket:`23349`, :ghc-ticket:`23828`).
